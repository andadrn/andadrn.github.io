        <h2>FIKI AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p class="lead" allign="justify">In this milestone we are going to give you an overview of our project. We will start by describing the problem we have identified and the solution we came up with. Also, we are going to give a brief overview of the customer segments, competition, key metrics, cost structure and revenue streams.</p>
        <h3><b>Problem: shortage of daily workers</b></h3>
        <p class="lead" allign="justify">Daily workers are hard to find these days. These have to do a job in a relatively short and limited time, but the amount of time needed to find one might be bigger than the actual time needed to just to the job. Moreover, the daily workers are not very happy with this situation because their clients tend to be lazy and get a well known company to do the job instead of searching for a good daily worker.</p>  
        <h3>Solution: a platform for people who offer and people who seek services</h3>
        <p class="lead" allign="justify">We propose a platform meant to make it easier for the clients to find a daily worker, and for the workers to find new clients. Thereby, we want to create a waily working market where one can find people who do some sort of jobs or offer himself to do a job</p>
