        <h2><b>LEAD GENERATION AND COLLECTION</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Bring people on our landing page</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">In order to promote our landing page we have created a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/taglich.official">page.</a></p>
        <p class="lead">In time, we have noticed that many people use Facebook groups to search daily workers and daily workers post to such groups as well. Taking this into account, we have decided to promote our application on Facebook.</p>
        <p class="lead">We have posted a brief description of the application and invited people to subscribe to our newsletter TODO</p>
        <img src="/img/fb_share.png">
        <p class="lead">It has been easier for us to promote the application using this page because we used the <i>Invite</i> option and also we have sent the link to our friends using the Facebook messenger.</p>
