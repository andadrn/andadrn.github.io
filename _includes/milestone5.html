        <h2><b>LEAD GENERATION AND COLLECTION</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Lead collection section on our landing page</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">We have modified our <a href="https://dspmihai.github.io/taglichofficial.github.io/">landing page</a> so that it contains a collection section. People can subscribe to our newsletter with their email address.</p>

        <h3><b>Analytics on our landing page</b></h3>
        <p class="lead"><b>Google Analytics</b></p>
        <p class="lead">TODO</p>
        <p class="lead"><b>HotJar</b></p>
        <p class="lead">We used HotJar to observe which areas of our landing page are most accessed.</p>
        <img src="/img/hotjar1.png"/>
        <p class="lead">There were only 4 clicks on subscribe because we have created a new landing page (the <a href="https://mailchi.mp/f3d08dd10b08/taglich">previous</a> one did not offer support for including HotJar).</p>
        <p class="lead">We have also noticed that people often clicked on the Facebook icon of our page.</p>

        <h3><b>Conversion rate</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">On the new landing page we had only 4 subscribers out of 35 visitors. For this new landing page the conversion rate is 8.75%, but we are confident this would have been much higher if the old landing page would have supported HotJar :).</p>
        <h3><b>Bring people on our landing page</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">In order to promote our landing page we have created a Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/taglich.official">page.</a></p>
        <p class="lead">In time, we have noticed that many people use Facebook groups to search daily workers and daily workers post to such groups as well. Taking this into account, we have decided to promote our application on Facebook.</p>
        <p class="lead">We have posted a brief description of the application and invited people to subscribe to our newsletter.</p>
        <img src="/img/fb_share.png">
        <p class="lead">We have noticed that it has been easier to promote the application using the Facebook page because of the large number of Facebook users. We have invited people to like our page using the <i>Invite</i> Facebook option and we also shared the page to our friends on Facebook Messenger.</p>
