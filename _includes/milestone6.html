        <h2><b>MARKET RESEARCH</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Size of the target market</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">We address 2 different sub-markets, namely: workers - people willing to find a daily job using our application and clients - people willing to find a daily worker suited to their needs and expectations through our platform.
</p>
        <p class="lead">According to an Eurostat survey regarding the Internet access and usage, 76% of the Romanian households have internet access, whereas 64% of the Romanian individuals, aged between 16 and 74 years, use the internet on a regular basis. The proportion of individuals aged between 16 and 74 years who ordered or bought goods or services over the internet for private use in Romania is 18% (~ 2.2 million people).
</p>
        <p class="lead">Considering that our main target clients are living in a city having more than 200 000 citizens, we will first address the market in Bucharest and subsequently, Cluj, Iasi and Timisoara. We will target 250 000 users, who are at least 24 years old and use the internet on a regular basis to buy goods or services over the internet or want to find a daily job, taking into account the previous provided information. We expect 50 000 daily workers to use our application.

</p>
        <h3><b>Competitors</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">In the targeted market we did not manage to identify direct competitors, due to the fact that at the current moment there are no dedicated platforms for the problem we address. However, there are 3 online platforms which allow users to publish different adverts, namely: La jumate, OLX and Publi24. We take into account that our targeted clients and workers may use these platforms as well.
</p>
        <h3><b>Possible market share of the competitors</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">All of the previously mentioned competitors are in fact online platforms which allow registered users to freely post adverts in order to buy or sell goods and services. Aditionally, users can update or promote their ads in exchange for money. Furthermore, each platform allows its users to filter ads by different criterias such as location, job type and so on. Users usually provide an email address or a telephone number in order to be contacted. There is also a history of the ads a user posted.
</p>
        <p class="lead">When determining the possible market share of the competitors we searched on each platform ads posted by people who are looking for daily workers and ads posted by daily workers looking for a job. The approximate number of these ads will help us estimate how many users of the platforms can become our clients.</p>
        <p class="lead">On La jumate we found 1000 ads for daily jobs available in Bucharest, including 91 searching for babysitters, 298 construction field jobs and 124 cleaning jobs.
</p>
        <p class="lead">On the other hand, OLX has much more ads of interest, namely 36 000. In these ads we found 7500 construction field jobs, 1700 appliance repair services and 5000 different daily jobs (babysitting, cleaning and so on).</p>
        <p class="lead">On Publi24 we found 7000 ads for services. In these ads we could find 600 ads posted by people willing to find a job (not necessarily a daily job), 700 ads for cleaning jobs, 150 ads for woodwork jobs.</p>
        <p class="lead">Based on the presented information we estimate that the possible market share for our competitiors is as follows:
</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lead">La jumate: 2.22%</li>
          <li class="lead">OLX: 81.81%</li>
          <li class="lead">Publi24: 15.9%</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Our estimated potential market share in year 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 after launch
</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">We assume that in the first year we will have a 35% market share, taking into account the fact that the application is dedicated, unlike these platforms.</p>
        <p class="lead">In the second year we expect to have a slightly bigger market share, considering that the users will be satisfied by our application. By this time we expect to have a share of loyal users.</p>
        <p class="lead">By the end of the third year we expect a 50% market share, with a majority of the ads posted on La jumate, OLX and Publi24 posted on our application as well. After the third year we will analyse the customersâ€™ satisfaction and we will try to address any issue they have so that they will not use any other platform to post their ads.
</p>
        <p class="lead">We expect a progressive growth and we estimate that in the fourth year we will have 60% of the market share, considering that in the meantime other competitors may appear.
</p>
        <p class="lead">By the end of the 5th year we expect to have at least 70% of the market share. We assume that until then we will launch a mobile version of the application and that will increase the number of customers, considering that many people nowadays use their smartphones in order to buy services over the internet.
</p>
        <p class="lead">One of the reasons we expect our customers to be loyal and satisfied by our services is given by the ranking feature of our application. In this way, people will have the possibility to choose who to work with and also to report any problem encountered.
</p>
        <h3><b>Total market value and our value of market share for the next 5 years</b></h3>
        <p class="lead">Considering that one worker would pay 3 euros monthly to find daily jobs and that we are targetting 50000 such workers, we expect a total market value of 1800000 euros after 5 years. We assume that after 5 years we will have 70% of the market share, therefore, we expect a value of our market share equal to 1260000 euros.
